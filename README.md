This project serves as a structured approach to sentiment analysis leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised machine learning models.

Key Components :

Data Preprocessing: Text normalization including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization for transforming textual data into numerical features.

Model Development: Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression to predict sentiment polarity.

Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive model assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
